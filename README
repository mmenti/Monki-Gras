Brewlove - a mobile app concept knocked up quickly for the Monki Gras conference

Prerequisites:
- API keys for Foursquare, Untappd and Bitly search
- Tornado web server

Overview:
A mobile web app for the Tornado web server (should work across most devices, Android and iOS etc.), written in Python and using HTML5 and JQuery Mobile - making use of Bitly realtime search, Untappd and Foursquare.

The concept is that it takes Untappd data, but starts at your location/the pubs around you, and then shows you what Untappd users have been drinking at each nearby pub. For each beer, you can then do a Bitly realtime search, to get up-to-date results mentioning that beer/brewery combination. 
You allow it to see your location, and it lists pubs/bar in the vicinity (taken from foursquare API), and when clicking on a venue, it will show any recent beer checkins on Untappd at that venue, and you can then click through to the beer details. Under the beer details, there's a "bitly realtime search" button, which does a bitly search for that beer.

For demo purposes, if there aren't enough pubs around you, there are 3 preset locations (Monki Gras London, Williamsburg Brooklyn and Mission St San Francisco) to let you pretend you're somewhere cooler ;)

I call it Brewlove - check it out on your mobile device at http://brew.lv

Known Issues:
- It only really works well if there is a fair number of Untappd users in pubs/bars around you
- It currently lists all pubs near you, even if they don't exist in Untappd (clicking on the pub name will tell you). This is due to trying to limit the number of Untappd API calls for the moment.
- There are some issues with certain Unicode characters, both in the display, and in the Bitly search (leading to some 500 errors). I'll try and get that fixed when I get the time.

Unknown Issues:
- Likely quite a few
